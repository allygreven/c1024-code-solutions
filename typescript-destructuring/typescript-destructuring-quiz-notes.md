## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is destructuring, conceptually?
  Destructuring is a way to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into separate variables.
  Conceptually, you can think of it like breaking open a box (the array or object) to grab the items (values or properties) inside and putting them directly into your hands (variables) for easier access.

- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?
  const { property of the object 1, property of the object 2 } = object;

- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?
  const [elements, separated, by, commas] = array

- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?
  Destructuring uses curly braces `{}` or square brackets `[]` on the left side of an assignment; literals use them on the right side
