## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
  is a specific point at which the layout of a website changes to accommodate different screen sizes or devices

- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
  Using a percentage width allows the column to adapt fluidly to different screen sizes, ensuring better responsiveness and flexibility, while a fixed width in pixels can lead to layout issues on smaller or larger devices

- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
  because of the css cascade
